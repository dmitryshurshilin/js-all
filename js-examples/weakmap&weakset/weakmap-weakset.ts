/**
 * A WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects,

 * strong references to its keys. That is, an object's presence
 * as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from being garbage collected.
 * Once an object used as a key has been collected, its corresponding values
 * in any WeakMap become candidates for garbage collection as well â€”
 * as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere.

/**
 * WeakSet objects are collections of objects. Just as with Sets,
 * each object in a WeakSet may occur only once; all objects
 * in a WeakSet's collection are unique.
 * 
 * The main differences to the Set object are:
 * WeakSets are collections of objects only.
 * They cannot contain arbitrary values of any type, as Sets can.
 * The WeakSet is weak, meaning references to objects
 * in a WeakSet are held weakly. If no other references
 * to an object stored in the WeakSet exist, those objects
 * can be garbage collected.
